title: Xbox Game Pass - the sword of Damocles

"The first taste is free" a phrase that comes to mind when considering
resubscribing to Xbox Game Pass.

Microsoft is behind Sony in market dominance, especially in Europe. How do they
get people to switch sides? Free games.

Well, not free, but offering a monthly subscription that's on offer at Â£1 for
three months. But once you're subscribed and getting the "free" games, then
what's the problem?

The reason I cancelled my subscription is because it felt too much like a bait
and switch. I didn't like waiting for the other shoe to drop and an announcement
of previously available games "transitioning out of availability".

In an ever-growing digital marketplace, the concept of ownership needs to be
more clearly defined. Steam's commitment to honour purchases is nice, but what
happens when they get bought out by Microsoft? Those commitments weren't legally
binding.

My view is to take full advantage of any company loss leading agendas while
keeping offline backups of anything you consider dear.

Meanwhile, I'll take that subscription money and donate it to a cause that
genuinely believes in game preservation
